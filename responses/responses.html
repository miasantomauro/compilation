          I found that Paul Ford’s use of humor in “What is Code” was a clever way to address the exclusionary nature of the tech industry. By using the pretentious tone and diction of “typical” (White and East Asian Male) programmers, he subverts the problematic narratives of these “keepers of the tech field” to some degree of success. Ford first elicits the respect of his targets, and then uses their words to slap them across the face. Personally, this made me cackle, but as I considered the author’s intentions more, I grew concerned that his attempt to break a negative cycle was contributing to it.

	I appreciated the documentation of the corrections others made to his article. I wonder if Ford used this as a tactic to gain trust and sympathy from the marginalized audiences he is speaking on behalf of. Perhaps some believe his ability to accept criticism renders him apt to speak for others (I must respectfully say that I am not convinced).

	As for the other article, I found it introduced many relevant topics without fully fleshing out the ideas and rationales involved. I admit that I am still confused about concepts like skeuomorphs, grains, and flux after reading this piece.

          Olia Lialina's piece, The Vernacular Web, is an outdated article about a doubly outdated iteration of the internet. She pays homage to a previous era by including elements such as tiled backgrounds and basic html on her page. Her criticism of past practices is ironic for a modern reader because her article appears just as ugly and old as her subject of writing must have appeared to her. Reading this article during the present adds a layer of meaning to the piece- It now draws attention to how silly strict judgement and criticism are in a field that is based on rapid and dramatic change and growth. The design principles that some adhere to may not be relevant in a few years. Trends in design are just that, trends. They are not objective rules, but subjective aesthetics.
	Lialina’s piece frames “Jodi’s Infrastructure”, an article which sheds light on art that exists on and within computers. The main theme in both of these pieces is the transitory nature of both art and the mediums through which its produced.

        <div class="sectionContent">
          “Capitalism vs. Privacy” explores its two titular subjects as they relate to the development of the internet. Though this piece succeeds in exposing the truths of the tech industry’s negligence towards consumers, it falls short in some of its reasoning. For example, an Ayn Rand quote is used to contextualize the rationale of early American capitalism. As quoted in the article, she says, “Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.” I find the use of this quote questionable in an article criticizing tech companies’ lack of concern for individual privacy.
	The article also compares the role of privacy in early capitalism to its role in capitalism today. The author claims that there is a transition in capitalism’s dependency on privacy. I don’t think this comparison is particularly valid because it fails to address the difference between privacy for firms and privacy for consumers. In both time periods, firms are benefitting from a lack of transparency. In both cases, consumers are the ones being exploited, whether that be through surreptitious business practices or data collection.
	“The Critical Atlas of the Internet” offers several theories that explain the spatial shape and size of the internet. I feel that this piece’s strength lies in its non-forceful tone and extremely detailed and relevant use of varied imagery. I thoroughly enjoyed pondering some of these ideas and appreciated the incorporation of both abstract and technical descriptions of the web.

        <div class="sectionContent">David Weinberger’s “New Clues” is an effective summary for the explorations we’ve made during this course. He touches on topics such as privacy, marketing, and networking. Despite the rigid organization of the piece, its voice and tone shine through to construct a narrative. Concise conclusions serve to summarize the ponderings of many of the writers we’ve read in a satisfying way.
	I like this piece for the same reason I like the Critical atlas of the internet, it provides many ideas in digestible portions. It isn’t too forceful or defensive. Additionally, this piece uses humor, creative constructions, and self awareness to get point across.</div>
